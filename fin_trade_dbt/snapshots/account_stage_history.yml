      Type 2 Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) snapshot that tracks changes in account lifecycle stages.
      Uses check strategy to monitor changes in the account_stage column, creating new records only
      when an account transitions between stages (New Account → First Week → First Month → Established).
      Each record maintains valid_from and valid_to dates to track the timeline of stage changes.
